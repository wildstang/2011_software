This directory contains the startup code for the VEX Robot Controller.  The complete "out-of-the-box" firmware
can be obtained by requesting it from IFI (infoif@innovationfirst.com).

To compile this code you must have Microchip's MPLAB IDE (6.62 or greater) with their C18 compiler 
installed on your system.

If you wish to restore your VEX Robot Controller to the default functionality as shipped from the factory, 
use the IFI Loader application to download the Vex_default_firmware.hex file to your Robot Controller (RC).  

The VexUserCode_DDT.mcw will build a hex file supporting the Dynamic Debug Tool (DDT). This tool enable a 
user to establish a connection from his PC to the RC. When used concurrently with the Microchip PIC18F8520 
Data Sheet and optionally with an oscilloscope, the DDT can be a powerful tool for learning the 
microcontroller’s architecture, for writing your custom code, and for debugging purposes.

CAUTION:  Do not relocate this VexCode directory very deep in your directory tree.  
  This is because the Microchip compiler has a 64 character path/filename limit.

NOTES  :  Use Vex_library.lib if you plan to use the Generate_Pwms() function.  This uses Timer0 to 
  synchronize any PWM outputs generated by the User processor to make sure they avoid any SPI interrupts.
  If you want to use Timer0 yourself, then you must replace Vex_library.lib with Vex_alltimers.lib (default)
  in the project.

- Added Vex_2008_library.lib.  This library supports the following modes:

- No Jumper : 	20 sec Autonomous, 120 sec Operator Control
- No Jumper : 	Autonomous mode continuous (Software Controlled)
-  (Note: txdata.user_cmd |= 0x02   - invokes Autonomous mode)

- Mode 1:	Operator Control mode continuous
- Mode 2:  	60 sec Autonomous Mode
- Mode 3: 	60 sec Operator Control mode

- Where :
- Mode 1  	INT6 Jumper off	INT5 Jumper on
- Mode 2  	INT6 Jumper on	INT5 Jumper off
- Mode 3  	INT6 Jumper on	INT5 Jumper on

8/11/2006
- Added VEX_MASTER_V7.BIN to support new competition requirements.  Now autonomous mode runs for 20 seconds 
-  followed by 2 minutes and 30 seconds of operator control mode.
- 
10/10/2005
- Added VEX_MASTER_V6.BIN to support autonomous mode (see HowToRunAutonomousMode.pdf for details).
-
- The following is a decription of the hex files included in the zipped project:
-
-   Vex_default_firmware.hex  
-   The original factory code also known as "out of the box" hex code. 
-
-   Vex_Startup_UserCode.hex 
-   The starter code that this project will create if you make no changes to the C files.
-
-   Vex_default_DDT.hex
-   The default DDT code that is used for PC to robot controller communications.

2/17/2005
- Added revised master version (VEX_MASTER_V5.BIN). Be sure to update the master firmware prior to loading user
  code.  The document called 'UpdatingMasterFirmware.pdf' explains how to update master firmware.

2/15/2005
- Now displays master and user code versions on a debug terminal. 
  Note : "User v1" is factory default user firmware.

2/08/2005
- Baseline default code released.
